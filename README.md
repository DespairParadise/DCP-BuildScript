# DCP-BuildScript
#### Repo and Instruction to build Despair Codec Pack


## Building

* Clone or Download ZIP
* Launch `BUILD.BAT`
* Wait and that's all


## I still doubt. Why there is some .exe/.dll ?

* `DCP-Core.exe`, `DCP-OneTime.exe`, `DCP-Settings.exe`:
  * Those executables are already FOSS: https://github.com/DespairParadise
  * You can still decompile using [DotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler) and check. Always check. Trust no one.
* `7zip\*`
  * Check [this](7zip/readme.md)
* `fciv.exe`
  * From Microsoft: [File Checksum Integrity Verifier](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11533)
  * You can right-click on the .exe, check in Proprieties [the signature](https://i.imgur.com/W7EUNuB.png)
